Kohn-Sham approximation

Considerations:
"Internal configuration"
	Particle type
	Charge
	Count
	Initial state
"External configurations"
	Gravity
	Magnetic waves
	Current ???
	Pressure -> This should be tailored via other params
	Temperature -> This should be tailored via other params
	Other external forces

Goals:
Simulate particle interaction in common environments
	Easy example is particles in water

Simulate particle interaction in extreme environment
	Fusion of Hydrogen/Deuterium into Helium in Plasma

Recognize differernt states of matter?
Perform chemical reactions

Questions:
What dictates temperature?

Timestep considerations:
choosing the correct time step is important as too large of a timestep will lead to model errors
Too small of a timestep and the simulation will be too slow.

Can we do a cheap analysis of the force calculations to determine a dynamic and suitable timestep?
	- In a slow system having a longer timestep is acceptable
	- In a very fast system the timestep must be much tighter.
		-Can we do a error calculation some sort of expected error based on time step.
		-Given an acceptable error we can get a function of timestep.
The big thing is to consider is whether or not having a dynamic timestep will provide benefit.
A simpler and perhaps better option is to look at the total temperature of the system and use that to do
an initial calculation check.
